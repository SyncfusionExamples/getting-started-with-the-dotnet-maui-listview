This project also explains on how to select items in the list, change its layout, and add a header and footer.

To run this application, you need to first clone the `getting-started-with-the-dotnet-maui-listview` repository and then open it in Visual Studio 2019. Now, simply build and run your project to view the output.

## Features and Benefits

###  Data binding
The ListView has data binding support to work out-of-the box with popular data sources such as List, ObservableCollection, and many more.

###  Different layouts
Data can be displayed in different layouts such as linear and grid. Both layouts are supported in the horizontal list view as well.

### Linear layout
The linear layout arranges items linearly in a single column vertically or a single row horizontally.

### Grid layout
The grid layout arranges items in a predefined number of columns and the number of columns can be changed.

### Grouping
A group is a collection of items that belong to a specific category. When grouping is applied, the data is organized into different groups based on key values.
